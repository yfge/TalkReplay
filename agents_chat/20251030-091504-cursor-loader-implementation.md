## Summary

- Implemented the Cursor provider loader to extract prompts and code artifacts from workspace storage, generating chat sessions with assistant snippets.
- Added sample Cursor fixtures, sqlite fallbacks, and a Vitest covering the new loader; documented progress in the milestone checklist.

## Code Highlights

```text
src/lib/providers/cursor.ts:1
src/lib/providers/cursor.test.ts:1
fixtures/cursor/sample-root/User/workspaceStorage/sample-workspace/workspace-state.json:1
tasks.md:76
```

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm format`

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Session detail lookup rebuilds context on demand; may need caching if performance regresses with large histories.
- Assistant text is synthesized from history snapshotsâ€”should revisit once Cursor exposes full transcripts or `debug.logComposer` is automatable.
