# Cursor Fixtures

Synthetic samples mirroring Cursor's local storage layout:

- `workspace-state-prompts.json` – value from the `aiService.prompts` key inside `state.vscdb`, capturing recent prompt history.
- `history-entry.json` – simplified `entries.json` excerpt from `User/History/<id>/entries.json`, linking resource URIs to per-file snapshots.

All data is anonymised and crafted to demonstrate schema structure without exposing real code or proprietary content.
