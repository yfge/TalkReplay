## Summary

- Ensured the Cursor loader resolves the sql.js wasm binary via package.json (Node runtime) while keeping the URL-based fallback for browser builds, preventing webpack from mis-resolving to `/node_modules/...` during tests.

## Code Highlights

```text
src/lib/providers/cursor.ts:76
```

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm format`

## Risks & Follow-Up

- If sql.js ships an official ESM entry we should drop the manual locate logic and rely on import.meta.url directly.
