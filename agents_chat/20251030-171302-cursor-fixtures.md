## Summary

- Expanded Cursor sample fixtures to include multi-turn chat data and tool invocation metadata for normaliser coverage.
- Added a second history snapshot so loader tests validate artifact pairing across multiple generations.
- Updated provider tests to assert both fallback and schema-normalised paths preserve assistant attachments and tool details.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm test`

## Risks & Follow-ups

- Still need real-world Cursor exports with additional message variants (images, multiple tool runs) to further harden parsing.
- Monitor Cursor updates that might change chatdata structure or tool metadata fields.
