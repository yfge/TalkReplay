## Summary

- Enabled async WebAssembly support in Next.js webpack config so `sql.js` can load its wasm module during Cursor ingestion.

## Code Highlights

```text
next.config.mjs:5
```

## Self-Tests

- Tests not run (config tweak only); kubo lint/test already cover previous commit and this change does not affect TS output.

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Keep an eye on bundle size; if client bundles pull in `sql.js`, consider server-only dynamic import.
