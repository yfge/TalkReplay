## Summary

- Inspected Cursor workspace storage to locate prompt history (`aiService.prompts`) and history manifests, then captured anonymised samples under `fixtures/cursor/`.
- Documented the observed schema in `docs/data-sources.md` and marked Milestone 1.C tasks for Cursor research/docs as complete.

## Code Highlights

fixtures/cursor/workspace-state-prompts.json:1
fixtures/cursor/history-entry.json:1

tasks.md:75
```

## Self-Tests

- Tests not run (data and documentation only).

## Risks & Follow-Up

- Cursor assistant replies are still not persisted locally; adapter work depends on mapping streamed responses once located.
- Need to design a synthetic assistant-response fixture if upstream storage remains inaccessible.
