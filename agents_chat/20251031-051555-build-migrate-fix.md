# 2025-10-31 Build migrate fix

## Summary

- Investigated `pnpm run build` failure reported after Cursor session detail debugging; TypeScript flagged missing `ProviderImportError` export and an incompatible `migrate` return type.
- Updated `src/app/api/sessions/route.ts` to import `ProviderImportError` from `@/types/providers`, keeping the API debug envelope typed.
- Hardened the persisted state migration in `src/store/chat-store.ts` to always return a `ChatPersistedState` object and avoid `unknown` leaks during version bumps.

## Code Highlights

```ts
// src/app/api/sessions/route.ts
import type { ProviderImportError } from "@/types/providers";
```

```ts
// src/store/chat-store.ts
migrate: (persisted, version) => {
  if (!persisted || typeof persisted !== "object") {
    return {};
  }
  const typedPersisted = persisted as ChatPersistedState;
  const next: ChatPersistedState = { ...typedPersisted };
  // ...sanitise sources and ensure cursor entries persist
  return next;
},
```

- Touched files: `src/app/api/sessions/route.ts`, `src/store/chat-store.ts`, `tasks.md`.

## Self-Tests

- `pnpm run build`
  - Expected: succeeds without type errors.
  - Actual: Next.js build completed; static generation summary recorded.

## Risks & Follow-ups

- Persisted state migration still lacks targeted unit coverage; consider adding regression tests around future version bumps.
- Monitor for additional provider-specific debug fields requiring shared typing.
